  # The `on:` option sets the relevant attribute for comparing timestamps.

  # The default is :updated_at, so updating a record, which was read by a
  # reader makes it unread again.
  #
  # Using :created_at, only new records will show up as unread. Updating a
  # record which was read by a reader, will NOT mark it as unread.
  #
  # Any other existing timestamp field can be used as `on:` option.
